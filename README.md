## Synopsis: 

This is a website for Crystal Clear Pool Service, managed by sole proprietor Daniel Semeryuk. The website will advertise his business and provide convenient features for 
his clients. His clients will be able to create an account for the website, which will allow them to subscribe to his services online and pay automatically, as well as
provide a convenient way to see payment and service history. New clients who find his business online are not obligated to create an account and can still choose to 
request an estimate in person and pay through traditional means like check or cash. 

## Testing:

Testing consists of ensuring that all web pages scale properly when zooming in/out and resizing the browser window. For data entry, simple SQL injection is tested which 
should be avoided by using prepared statements and grants. 

## Deployment:

Deployment of this website consists of reserving a hostname, choosing a hosting service, and migrating all source code for deployment.

## Developer instructions: 

## Include software logo, creative images, ERD, prototype images or actual images 

## Use your JIRA to create a timeline section with key milestones for your project

NOTE: When coming up with the timeline this is the timeline for what you expect to get done in 191 based on the user stories you created in the backlog for all the key features with estimates.
